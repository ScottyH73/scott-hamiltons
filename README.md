Welcome all,
I'm big into notes, so this README file will probably start looking more like most of my notes. While I'll forever be honing down my note taking methods.

I utilize ISO standards as much as possible. For example the dating convention ISO 8601.
2025-04-20 0311:00:00.000
However, I don't need to use millisecondes for anything I do right now, so I fall back to this
202504200300 which represents YYYYMMDDHHMM.
I really only need the date and time to the minnute so If you see that string of numbers anywhere in my documents, that is what that is. Thank you for playing.
